We're happy to announce that at least three Namecoin developers will be at [38C3 (the 38th Chaos Communication Congress)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in Hamburg, December 27-30. Additionally, at least two Namecoin developers will be at [FOSDEM 2025](https://www.fosdem.org/2025/).

We expect to give some talks, however, the details are still in flux and will probably not be announced until shortly before the beginning of the respective conferences; keep an eye on both the C3 and FOSDEM schedules to find us (or find our absence, if we are unlucky). Recordings and live-streams may happen as well.

As you may recall, last year's Congress (37C3) was the first year that Namecoin stepped out from Monero's shadow to form our own Assembly. This was a huge success for all involved, and the Namecoin Assembly is back this year. Of course, we remain close friends with Monero. Meanwhile this will be our first time attending FOSDEM, so we're very excited to see what we've been missing all these years.

If you'd like to meet up with us at C3, the usual methods (c3nav, etc) should lead you to us. Meanwhile if you'd like to meet up with us at FOSDEM, you can say hello in the #namecoin-dev Matrix channel, or you can ask at the NLnet table and perhaps they may be able to point you in our direction.
